# Introduction to SQL
#### What is SQL?
SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is the programming language used to communicate with a relational database.

SQL is a powerful language that uses simple sentences that, with a few lines, allow you to Select (find), Insert (add), Update (change), and Delete (remove) a large amount of data.

There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

#### Relational databases
A relational database is a database organized according to the relational model of data. In simple terms, the relational model defines a set of relations (which we can think of as analogous to tables) and describes the relationships, or connections, between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact. Using the relational model elevates our database from data that is represented in just a flat, two-dimensional table, to one where we can describe the data in a more complex and detailed way. Using a relational database helps us to cut down on duplicated data and provides a much more useful data structure for us to interact with.
