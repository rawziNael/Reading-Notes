Android Tasks and the Back Stack
When completing a certain job, users engage with a task, which is a set of actions. In the back stack, activities are ordered in the order in which they are opened. When several programs are running in a multi-windowed environment, the system maintains tasks for each window individually, and each window might contain many tasks. For most tasks, the device's Home screen is the starting point. When a user taps an icon in the app launcher, the job of that app is brought to the front. If no task for the app exists, a new task is created, and the app's "main" activity is opened as the stack's root activity. The new activity is put to the top of the stack and takes attention when the current activity starts another. The prior action is still in the stack, but it is no longer active. The system preserves the current state of its user interface after an activity ends. Activities in the stack are never reorganized; instead, they are put onto and popped off of the stack, or placed into the stack when the current activity starts and popped off when the user departs. When users start a new task or return to the Home screen, a task might be moved to the "background." Managing Tasks - Android organizes tasks and the back stack by grouping related actions into a single task and stacking them "last in, first out." You may define how a new instance of an activity is connected with the current task using launch modes. Different launch modes may be defined in two ways: utilizing a manifest file or using intent flags. When declaring an activity in your manifest file, you can use the element's launchMode property to describe how the activity should be associated with a task. Flags in the startActivity intent - When beginning an activity, you may change the default association of the activity to its task by providing flags in the startActivity intent. An activity's handling affinities indicate which task it likes to be assigned to. The taskAffinity property of the element may be used to change the affinity for any particular activity. The taskAffinity property accepts a string value that must be distinct from the element's default package name, as the system utilizes that name to identify the app's default task affinity. Getting rid of the rear stack If a user abandons a job for an extended period of time, the system deletes all activities except the root activity. Only the root activity is restored when the user returns to the job.

Android SharedPreferences
When you have a tiny collection of key-values that you'd like to preserve, use the SharedPreferences APIs. The SharedPreferences object links to a file containing key-value pairs and provides easy read and write methods for them. The framework manages each SharedPreferences file, which can be private or shared. By using one of these methods, you may create a new shared preference file or access an existing one. getSharedPreferences() is useful if you require several shared preference files identified by name, which you supply with the first parameter. GetPreferences() may be used from any Context in your app, but you should use it from an Activity if you only need to utilize one shared preference file for the activity. You don't need to provide a name because this obtains the activity's default shared preference file.Create a SharedPreferences to write to a shared preferences file. Edit your SharedPreferences by using edit(). Use methods like putInt() and putString() to pass the keys and values you want to write. Then, to preserve the changes, use apply() or commit(). Call methods like getInt() and getString() to obtain values from a shared preferences file, passing in the key for the value you want and, optionally, a default value to return if the key isn't there.
