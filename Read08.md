#### Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
#### Rule of Three (code duplication)  
is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.  
Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain. 

#### You aren't gonna need it  
"You aren't gonna need it"(YAGNI), is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.  
YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work".  

#### Minimum viable product  
A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.  
Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements.
