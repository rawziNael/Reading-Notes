# Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.

Each person in a Linked List is called a Node.
The first Node in the List is called the Head.  

#### How the LinkedList works  
The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.  

#### LinkedList Methods
For many cases, the ArrayList is more efficient as it is common to need access to random items in the list, but the LinkedList provides several methods to do certain operations more efficiently:

#### Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:  

Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)  
The amount of time a function needs to complete.  

Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)  
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.
