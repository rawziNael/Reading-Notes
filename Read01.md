### Language Basics
#### Variables:
Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data.
A variable is a name given to a memory location.
There are two types of variable in Java programming language:
Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields):
Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
Class Variables (Static Fields):
Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
