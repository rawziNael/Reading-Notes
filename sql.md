# Introduction to SQL
#### What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

###### Did you know?
There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

#### Relational databases
A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.
