# Introduction to SQL
#### What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

###### Did you know?
There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

#### Relational databases
A relational database is a database organized according to the relational model of data. In simple terms, the relational model defines a set of relations (which we can think of as analogous to tables) and describes the relationships, or connections, between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact. Using the relational model elevates our database from data that is represented in just a flat, two-dimensional table, to one where we can describe the data in a more complex and detailed way. Using a relational database helps us to cut down on duplicated data and provides a much more useful data structure for us to interact with.
