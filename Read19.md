# Spring and Sockets  
In computer science, purely functional programming usually designates a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.  

# Difference between pure and impure functional programming  
The exact difference between pure and impure functional programming is a matter of controversy. 

Purely functional data structures are persistent. Persistency is required for functional programming; without it, the same computation could return different results. Functional programming may use persistent non-purely functional data structures, while those data structures may not be used in purely functional programs.  

# Properties of purely functional programming  

- Strict versus non-strict evaluation  
- Parallel computing  
- Data structures  

# Purely functional language  
A purely functional language is a language which only admits purely functional programming. Purely functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purely functional.
