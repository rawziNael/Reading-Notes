# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### What Is a Class?  
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  
### What Is an Object?  
A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state.  
The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created at runtime from templates, which are also known as classes.

Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:

1- Using the code as modules and being able to control which module can be used where.
2- Privacy of data by making it private.
3- being able to re-use your code.
4- being able to debug the code easily.


### What Is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.  
```
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
``` 
### Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
A Binary Number is made up of only 0s and 1s.
A Decimal Number (based on the number 10) contains a Decimal Point.
