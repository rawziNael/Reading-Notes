# Arrays, Loops, Imports
#### Loops
Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.  
In Java we have different types of loops:  
1- For loop
```
{
  for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```
2- While loop
3- Do while loop
