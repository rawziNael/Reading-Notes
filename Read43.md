# What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?  

Open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses who use it, as well as to its programmers.  
 
For many outside of the IT world, the concept of contributing to open-source software seems like a remarkable psychological phenomenon, as many of the contributors do it by their own free will and are quite often unpaid for it.

Here is a list of some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:  

1- Improve Coding Skills  
2- Gain Early Experience  
3- Increase Community and Peer Recognition
